### TED 道歉的力量

**For the past few years, we've been calling men out. It had to be done.**
过去的几年里,我们在呼吁人们,这是必须做的
**But lately, I've been thinking we need to do something even harder. We need, as my good friend Tony Porter says, to find a way to call men in.**
但后来,我们在想我们需要做一些甚至更难的事.我们需要,就像我的好朋友 Tony Porter 说的,找到一个方法去召集人们
**My father began to sexually abuse me when I was five years old. He would come into my room in the middle of the night. He appeared to be in a trance. The abuse continued until I was 10. When I tried to resist him, when I was finally able to say no, he began to beat me. He called me stupid. He said I was a liar.**
我爸爸开始对我性虐待, 在我五岁的时候.他会进我的房间在半夜. 他出现是在恍惚中的. 虐待一直持续直到我 10 岁. 当我试着抵抗他,当我最终可以说不,他开始打我,他说我蠢,他说我是一个骗子.
**The sexual abuse ended when I was 10, but actually, it never ended. It changed who I was. I was filled with anxiety and guilt and shame all the time, and I didn't know why. I hated my body, I hated myself, I got sick a lot, I couldn't think, I couldn't remember things. I was drawn to dangerous men and women who I allowed -- actually, I invited -- to treat me badly, because that is what my father taught me love was.**
性虐待结束当我 10 岁, 但事实上, 它从未结束. 它改变了我. 我一直充斥着焦虑和内疚还有羞耻,而且我不知道为什么, 我讨厌我的身体, 我讨厌我自己, 我得了很多病, 我不能思考, 我不能记住事情. 我被那些我允许的危险的男人和女人牵着--事实上, 我被邀请--去坏的试我, 因为那就是我父亲教育我的爱是什么
**I waited my whole life for my father to apologize to me. He didn't. He wouldn't. And then, with the recent scandals of famous men, as one after another was exposed, I realized something: I have never heard a man who has committed rape or physical violence ever publicly apologize to his victim. I began to wonder, what would an authentic, deep apology be like?**
我整个人生在等待着我父亲对我道歉. 他没有. 他不会. 然后,随着最近男性的丑闻, 一个接着另一个的被揭露, 我意识到一些事情: 我从没听到那些犯了强奸罪或者身体的暴力的男人曾经公开的道歉对受害者. 我开始思考, 一个真正的,深深的道歉会是什么样?
**So, something strange began to happen. I began to write, and my father's voice began to come through me. He began to tell me what he had done and why. He began to apologize. My father is dead almost 31 years, and yet, in this apology, the one I had to write for him, I discovered the power of an apology and how it actually might be the way to move forward in the crisis we now face with men and all the women they abuse.**
因此,开始发生了一些奇怪的事. 我开始写作, 然后我父亲的声音开始穿过我. 他开始告诉我他做了什么和为什么这么做.他开始道歉, 我的父亲在 31 岁左右死去, 可是, 在这个道歉中, 一点我必须为他写, 我发现一个道歉的力量以及它真的可能是一个方法让我们现在面对的和男人和所有他们虐待的女人在危机中前进
**Apology is a sacred commitment. It requires complete honesty. It demands deep self-interrogation and time. It cannot be rushed. I discovered an apology has four steps, and, if you would, I'd like to take you through them.**
道歉是一个神圣的承诺. 它需要完全的诚实. 它需要深深的自我反省和时间. 它不能变的匆忙. 我发现一个道歉有四步,而且,如果你要道歉, 我就会喜欢拿你通过他们
**The first is you have to say what, in detail, you did. Your accounting cannot be vague. "I'm sorry if I hurt you" or "I'm sorry if I sexually abused you" doesn't cut it. You have to say what actually happened. "I came into the room in the middle of the night, and I pulled your underpants down." "I belittled you because I was jealous of you and I wanted you to feel less." The liberation is in the details. An apology is a remembering. It connects the past with the present. It says that what occurred actually did occur.**
第一步是你必须说在细节上你做了什么. 你的解释不能模糊. "我对你很抱歉如果我伤害了你"或者"我很抱歉我如果我性虐待了你" 不要说出这些. 你必须说真正发生了什么. "我进了房间在半夜, 并且我拉下了你的内裤." "我贬低了你因为我嫉妒你而且我想要你感觉少点" 解放是在细节中的. 一个道歉是一个记忆. 它连接了过去和现在. 它说了的发生了什么事是真的发生了的
**The second step is you have to ask yourself why. Survivors are haunted by the why. Why? Why would my father want to sexually abuse his eldest daughter? Why would he take my head and smash it against a wall? In my father's case, he was a child born long after the other children. He was an accident that became "the miracle." He was adored and treated as the golden boy. But adoration, it turns out, is not love. Adoration is a projection of someone's need for you to be perfect onto you. My father had to live up to this impossible ideal, and so he was never allowed to be himself. He was never allowed to express tenderness or vulnerability, curiosity, doubt. He was never allowed to cry. And so he was forced to push all those feelings underground, and they eventually metastasized. Those suppressed feelings later became Shadowman, and he was out of control, and he eventually unleashed his torrent on me.**
第二步是你必须问自己为什么, 幸存者为什么要被骚扰. 为什么? 为什么我父亲想要性侵他最年长的女儿? 为什么他拿着我的头还去把它撞在墙上? 在我父亲的情境中, 他是一个孩子出生的在其他孩子之后的. 他是一个意外变成了"奇迹". 他被崇拜和对待作为金童. 但是崇拜, 它转变了, 不是爱. 崇拜是某个人需要的推测为了你变得完美. 我父亲必须活着到不可能的理想,并且 因此他从来不被允许做他自己. 他从来不被允许去表达倾向或者弱点,好奇,怀疑. 他从来不被允许去哭. 而且因此他被强迫去推所有的感觉到地下, 并且他们最后转移了. 这些被抑制的感觉最后变成了影子, 并且他不能控制, 并且他最终释放了他的激流在我身上
**The third step is you have to open your heart and feel what your victim felt as you were abusing her. You have to let your heart break. You have to feel the horror and betrayal and the long-term impacts of your abuse on your victim. You have to sit with the suffering you have caused.**
第三步是你必须打开你的心还要体会你的受害者感受到了什么就像你被她虐待. 你必须让你的心破碎. 你必须感受到恐怖和背叛以及长期的被你的虐待和你的受害者影响. 你必须坐着和你引起的遭遇
**And, of course, the fourth step is taking responsibility for what you have done and making amends.**
还有, 当然, 第四步是担负责任 为你做的和制造了什么事赔偿
**So, why would anyone want to go through such a grueling and humbling process? Why would you want to rip yourself open? Because it is the only thing that will set yourself free. It is the only thing that will set your victim free. You didn't just destroy your victim. You destroyed yourself. There is no one who enacts violence on another person who doesn't suffer from the effects themselves. It creates an incredibly dark and contaminating spirit, and it spreads throughout your entire life.**
因此,为什么有人想要经历这些折磨和耻辱呢? 为什么你想撕开自己呢? 因为那是唯一让你自己自由的事. 那是唯一让你的受害者自由的事. 你不只是破坏你的受害者,你还破坏了自己, 没有一个制定暴力对其他人不会遭受他们影响的. 它创造了一个难以置信的黑暗和精神的污染, 而且一直在你完整的生命中传递
**The apology I wrote -- I learned something about a different lens we have to look through to understand the problem of men's violence that I and one billion other women have survived. We often turn to punishment first. It's our first instinct, but actually, although punishment sometimes is effective, on its own, it is not enough. My father punished me. I was shut down, and I was broken. I think punishment hardens us, but it doesn't teach us. Humiliation is not revelation. We actually need to create a process that may involve punishment, whereby we open a doorway where men can actually become something and someone else.**
我写下的道歉, 我学到了一些事关于一个不同的视角我们必须看到去理解那些我和十亿其他女性遭遇的男人的暴力的问题. 我们首先经常会去惩罚. 那是我们第一本能. 但是事实上, 虽然惩罚有时候是有效的, 但是在我自己的问题上, 它还不够. 我的父亲惩罚我, 我被压制, 而且我被破坏. 我认为惩罚让我们坚硬, 但是它不会教我们. 羞耻没有揭露. 我们真的需要创造一个进程可能涉及惩罚, 凭借此我们打开一个门,在那男人可以真正的成为一些事或一些人
**For so many years, I hated my father. I wanted him dead. I wanted him in prison. But actually, that rage kept me connected to my father's story. What I really wanted wasn't just for my father to be stopped. I wanted him to change. I wanted him to apologize. That's what we want. We don't want men to be destroyed, we don't want them to only be punished. We want them to see us, the victims that they have harmed, and we want them to repent and change. And I actually believe this is possible. And I really believe it's our way forward. But we need men to join us. We need men now to be brave and be part of this transformation. I have spent most of my life calling men out, and I am here now, right now, to call you in.**
很多年来, 我讨厌我父亲, 我想他死, 我想要他进监狱. 但是事实上, 愤怒使我继续写我父亲的故事, 我真正想要的不只是我父亲被停止. 我想要的是他改变, 我想要他道歉, 那就是我想要的. 我们不想让男人被破坏, 我们不想他们只是被惩罚, 我们想要他们看到我们, 那些受害者那些被他们伤害的人, 而且我们想要他们忏悔和改变. 而且我真的相信这是可能的, 而且我真的相信那是我们前进的方法. 但是我们需要男人来加入我们. 我们需要男人现在勇敢的成为这个改革的一部分. 我花了我大部分的生命来呼吁男人,而且我现在在这, 现在, 呼吁你们进来
**Thank you**
谢谢
